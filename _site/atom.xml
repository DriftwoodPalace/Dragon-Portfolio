   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The dragon portfolio is a portfolio construction that was presented by Christopher Cole in his 2020 paper “The allegory of the hawk and serpent - How to build a portfolio that lasts 100 years”. If you haven’t read the paper I recommend that you start by doing that. You can read it by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artemiscm.com/welcome#research&quot;&gt;https://www.artemiscm.com/welcome#research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is not about the content of the paper. This site is about how you can implement the portfolio yourself. Ever since the paper was released, discussions about how a normal retail investor could implement the portfolio has been going on. Some of the components in the dragon portfolio is hard for retail investors to invest in. The problem is amplified by securities law that stops people like Chris Cole to talk much about how to implement the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an US investor, I’m sorry I can’t help you. From what I’ve read it’s hard to implement this portfolio unless you are an accredited investor. The good news is that it’s easier to become one these days. From what I understand, you can do a “Series 65” to become an accredited investor: $175 in fees, ~60 hours of study and a 3 hour test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implementation of the portfolio is targeted at European investors. We have different laws in Europe and it’s usually fairly simple to invest in hedge funds and other actively managed funds that’s needed to implement the dragon portfolio the correct way. As I’m Swedish I’m mostly using Swedish vehicles. But I believe they should be fairly easy to replace with instruments in your own country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, myself, plan to put at least 80% of my net worth in to this portfolio and hold it for 30 years+. So any critique or suggestions for how to improve my implementation of the portfolio is welcome. I am not a professional investor, so this is not investment advise. Do your own research etc. If you want to contact me, feel free to do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DriftwoodPalace&quot;&gt;@DriftwoodPalace&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
